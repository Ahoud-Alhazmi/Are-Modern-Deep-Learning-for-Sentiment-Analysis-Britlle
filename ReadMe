--------------------------------------------------------
Are Modern Deep Learning Models for Sentiment Analysis Brittle? An Examination on Part-of-Speech


Datasets
--------------------------------------------------------
Download datasets from
1.	IMDB : http://ai.stanford.edu/amaas/data/sentiment/
2.	Yelp-Reviews: https://www.yelp.com/dataset/challenge
3. MR: http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/pabo/movie-review-data/

Setup
--------------------------------------------------------
You need Python 3, and all system dependencies possibly required by (Keras , NLTK , Pandas , Seaborn , Numpy , IPython.display and Matplotlib)


Tokens
-------------------------------------------------------
  1. Adjectives (Adj) 
  2. Verbs (Verb)
  3. Adverbs (Adv) 
  4. The combinations of adjectives and adverbs (Adj-Adv)
  5. The combinations of adjectives and verbs (Adj-Verb)
  6. The combinations of verbs and adverbs (Verb-Adv)
  7. The combination among adjectives, verbs, and adverbs (All)


Perturbations on Words
--------------------------------------------------------
    1. Swap
    2. Middle Shuffle
    3. Transformation


Attack Model
--------------------------------------------------------
The models are Bidirectional LSTM  and CNN-LSTM 


#The instructions for running the code
--------------------------------------------------------
Note: for each folder, there are models and three other files for attacking these models. 

1. Downloads the datasets:IMDB, YELP Review and MR datasets as csv file. 
2. Run the models (LSTM and CNN-LSTM). Save the models and use the same names for load the model in step 2 
3. Select one of the attacking files. 
4. Identify one of the strategies (Swap , Shuffle, or Antonym)
5. Determine target Tokens. 
6. Write the name file that will be saved the results.
